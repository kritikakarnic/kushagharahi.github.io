## kusha.me
Personal Website

Source code for [kusha.me](https://kusha.me), my static portfolio website and blog built on VueJS and hosted on GitHub pages.

Essentials:
* Clone repo
* Make sure you have `npm` installed
* Run `npm install` to restore dependencies 
* For dev work run: `npm run build` This launches a [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) on `8080`. 
* For pre-rendering and compiling website run: `npm run buildprod`, it will output to `/dist`

[Check out v1 built with AngularJs(1.0) and Typescript(2.0)](https://github.com/kushagharahi/kushagharahi.github.io/tree/AngularTS)
